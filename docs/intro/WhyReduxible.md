# Why Reduxible?

## Make Universal Application Easily with React + Redux

React, Redux and other related assets are already good enough to use directly. But some people (like me) just want to focus on application codes and don't want to spend time on building and maintaining the structure of the project. So I've wrapped and integrated mandatory libraries for React + Redux Application. If you use **Reduxible**, only what you need to do is code and set Router, Middleware, Reducers, and React Components to Reduxible. Then, you can run & see the React + Redux App immediately. Also, it can be a Universal App or Single Page App by config.

## We Need Long-Term Framework!

The environment of React and Redux has been changed very quickly almost every day. There are also a ton of related libraries and APIs changing frequently. But for building real products, we need stable and verified stuff. Reduxible provides useful modules having many references to make a universal application with React and Redux. And they are peer dependencies, so you can update them for the minor update. Reduxible will provide fixed APIs by wrapping the modules and will not be updated, except in a case of critical bugs. Therefore, you can only focus on building your own business features for your application without concerning or modifying integration codes of the application. Reduxible will provide Long-Term Services for React + Redux application that even can be run in the **Internet Explorer 8!** (I really really hate it, but for many reason, lots of people have to support it.)
